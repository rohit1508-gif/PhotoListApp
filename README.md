I have built an application named PhotoApp which has 3 activities. First one is a splash screen. Second one is known as PhotoListActivity which contains list of images and third one is ViewPhotoActivity where the particular image can be seen. I took approx 3-4 hours to built the application with nice UI. The application uses volley for api calling and uses picasso library for viewing image from provided url. RecyclerView has been used to show the list of images.
